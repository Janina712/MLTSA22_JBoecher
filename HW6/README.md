I received a 72-hour extension to complete this assignment. 

I had a short discussion with Kristina on Monday to talk about the variance function. Since I was short of time, I simply copied her code for this function. After I received the extension, I went over it again to ensure my understanding of it. I hope I'd be able to produce it myself now. 
I completed the remaining part of the assignment alone. 

The topic of this homework was change point detection methods. I think I got a little bit more comfortable reading (and understanding!) package documentations, since it was required for using rupture.
