This series of assignments was a challenge. I relied a lot on Miguel and might have convinced myself of understanding more than I actually do. However, I did learn a lot in the process. 

1. Conceptualizing a plan of action. Laying out a to-do list to complete a project. 
2. Things that look simple are not simple. 
3. Reshaping and reorganizing of dataframes and arrays. 
4. Familiarized with keras 

Besides Miguel, I also consulted with Kristina and Ilya to do this homework. I had discussions with all of them and Miguel shared his notebook in addition to that. I looked at it whenever I was stuck. I tried finding my own ways of achieving each sub-step.
