This series of assignments was a challenge. I relied a lot on Miguel and might have convinced myself of understanding things that I couldn't actually do myself. I'm a little upset with myself for needing so much guidance and obtaining a terrible model in the end. However, I did learn a lot in the process. 

1. Conceptualizing a plan of action. Laying out a to-do list to complete a project. 
2. Things that look simple are not simple. 
3. Reshaping and reorganizing of dataframes and arrays. 
4. Familiarized with keras 

Besides Miguel, I also consulted with Kristina and Ilya to do this homework.
