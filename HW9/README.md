This series of assignments was a challenge. However, I did learn a lot in the process. 

1. Conceptualizing a plan of action. Laying out a to-do list to complete a project. 
2. Things that look simple are not simple. 
3. Reshaping and reorganizing of dataframes and arrays. 
4. Familiarized with keras
