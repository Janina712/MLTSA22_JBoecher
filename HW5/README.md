I completed this assignment independently, but consulted with Kristina Rainich about calculating intracluster variance. I didn't notice the nested for-loop suggestion at the end of the instructions and performed the calculation the lazy way - by using a sklearn function. Kristina implemented the manual option and shared the code with me. 

My main take-away is the comparison of assigning the data to different numbers of clusters. Compared to previous assignments, I made an effort to document my steps and to interpret outputs as detailed as possible following the feedback I received.
