In this part of the assignment, we prepare the plasticc dataset from the kaggle challenge for the autoencoder. The structure of the data that the autoencoder takes an input should be organized such that each row corresponds to a time series (each passband of each object is considered its own ts). The columns should contain the data value at each time stamp. In addition to reshaping the dataframe, this assignment involved an interpolation problem. The time series are sampled at irregular intervals. Gaussian processes were used to predict missing data points for regularly spaced out time points.
