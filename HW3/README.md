The goal of the assignment was to learn about ARMA and ARIMA models and to get familiar with the workflow associated with predicting time series data. 
The questions about the meaning of the coefficients were designed to get us to think about what different parts of the model actually mean and strengthened 
my understanding of the theoretical background.
