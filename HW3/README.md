For this assignment, I worked together with Kristina Rainich and Kopo Oromeng. 

I completed the assignment by myself before meeting with my group on Monday. My teammates pointed out some errors and we had a discussion.  
Specifically, Kristina noticed that I forgot to split the data for the prediction into training and test sets. 
Kopo mentioned insights into the question about the threshold value that I included in my answer. 
And probably other things...

The goal of the assignment was to learn about ARMA and ARIMA models and to get familiar with the workflow associated with predicting time series data. 
The questions about the meaning of the coefficients were designed to get us to think about what different parts of the model actually mean and strengthened 
my understanding of the theoretical background.
