For this assignment, I worked together with Kristina Rainich. Jonathan shared his code with us and I used it when I got stuck defining the reduced chi2 function. 

The purpose of the assignment was to introduce us to different ways of modeling time series data and to evaluate their fit. We gained experience working with facebook prophet and accessing weather data from the web.
