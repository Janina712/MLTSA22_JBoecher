I had a hard time with this assignment. I don't think I fully understand how gaussian processes are fit to ts data/what exactly the code is doing, particularly in the parameter optimization section. I also ran out of time at the end after spending a lot of time just on getting data in the right format and that sort of thing. 

I think I learnt about data management and code organization. At some point I had a bunch of variables called lcvs_something until I got confused and re-structured the layout. I have a much better idea of what feature extraction means, but gaussian processes will continue to be an area of growth...
